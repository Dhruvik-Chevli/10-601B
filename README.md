# 10-601B
Assignments for the Introduction to Machine Learning (10601B - Fall 2018) @ CMU. 


All the assignments are solved using Python 3.6.5 (Anaconda Distribution). 

If you are currently taking the 10-601B course, I encourage you to try the assignments on your own and preferably not use the code snippets here - since this is a violation of the academic integrity policy of the institute. 

If you are here for learning different concepts, please go ahead and refer any of the code snippets.
